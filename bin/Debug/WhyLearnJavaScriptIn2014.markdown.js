//code Why Learn JavaScript in 2014?
/**
Before we start: 

<br/>  

* Who never wrote a line of JavaScript?

* Who hate JavaScript?

* Who do not understand JavaScript?

* Who ever read a book about JavaScript the language?

**/
//code Very short history - The bad part
/**

* ***JavaScript*** was created in 1995 by Bredan Eich as part of the Netscape Web Browser (*Legend says in 2 weeks*)

<center>![](../BredanEich.jpg)</center>

* It was adopted by million of Web users very quickly and **because**:<br/><br/>
    * It was created for beginner
    * Compatibilty reason
    * Browser wars between Sun, Netscape, Microsoft
    * Designed by Committee (TC39, ECMAScript)
<br/><br/>
* ***The language contains a lot dangerous and stupid features, that cannot and will not be fixed***

**/
//code  Very short history - The good part
/**

* ***But*** JavaScript is not as bad as it looks

* JavaScript is also misundertsood

    * It looks like Java or C#, it is closer to LISP

    * Developers say they hate JavaScript, but what they really hate is the DOM

    * Developers think they know JavaScript without ever having read a book about it

//code Why learn JavaScript 2014?
/**
* It is not just for the Web anymore

* Can be extremely fast 

* Since 2008 a lot of new tools and technologies have been created that use JavaScript

    * Server side applications

    * Mobile development

    * Database

    * New programming languages

    * Portable Virtual Machine - Assembly language of the web.

**/
//code Why learn JavaScript 2014?
/**
* If all you know is statically compiled programming languages like

    * C, Pascal, C++, Java, C#, VB<br/><br/>

* It is time you try the world of Dynamic Language like: 

    * Python, Ruby, Lua or JavaScript<br/><br/> 

<center>
## By learning how to programming with such a languages you will become a better C# programmer
</center>

* Let's review what happens since 2008


**/
//code  2008 - V8
/**
* In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser

* The Chrome browser use the JavaScript engine called ***V8***, which was the first one released to use **Just In Time Compilation**

* By 2014 all major browsers (FireFox, IE9, Safari) have some form of very fast JavaScript engine using JIT and other specific technologies.

**/
//code 2010 - CoffeeScript
/**
<center>![](../CoffeeScript.png)</center>

* In December 2010, Jeremy Ashkenas, released CoffeeScript 1.0 compiler

* CoffeeScript is a programming language that **transcompiles** to JavaScript

* The language is inspired by Ruby and Python to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability and adding additional features

* We have more and more language that transcompiles to javaScript:

    * Dart
    * Google Web Toolkit (Java -> JavaScript)
    * ClojureScript (Clojure language)
    
**/
//code 2011 - NodeJS
/**    
<center>
![](../300px-Node.js_logo.svg.png)
</center>

* Node.js is a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications.

    * Written in C++ and same JavaScript source code can run on Linux, Windows, MacOS X.
    * Use Google JavaScript engine V8 (extremely fast)
        * Single-threaded
        * Non-blocking I/O (Asynchrounous programming)<br/><br/>

* Ryan Dahl, release NodeJs 2010/2011
    
* Extremely Successfull

* Microsoft has invested on NodeJS for Windows and Azur

**/
//code 2012 - TypeScript
/**
<center>
![alt text](../TypeScript.png)
</center>

* In 2012, Microsoft release TypeScript which add Types to JavaScript.

* What is interresting with TypeScript is the way it add Types
    * Optional
    * Ligth 
        * Not used at runtime
        * Only used at edit time
            * Catch error
            * Intellisense
            * Refactoring tool

**/
//code NoSQL Databases
/**
* MongoDB (use the Firefox JavaScript Engine)

* RavenDB (use the JavaScript engine Jint v 0.9 and should used Jint v 2.0 (contributor))

* Windows Azure Mobile Service: 

    * Allow to customize the data getting in and out using JavaScript (I think they use NodeJS)

**/
//code HTML5 + Mobile + PhoneGap
/**

PhoneGap is a mobile development framework that enables software programmers to build applications for ***mobile devices*** using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

* PhoneGap Build http://phonegap.com

    * iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Black berry and other    s

    * Combined with library like jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Kendo UI.

* Telerik AppBuilder http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder


**/
//code ASM.js
/**
What it it ? 

* Asm.js is a strict subset of JavaScript that can be used as a low-level, efficient target language for compilers.


What does it mean? 
<br/><br/>
<center>
***Asm.js transform a JavaScript runtime into a Virtual Machine like JVM or .NET Runtime.***
</center>

**/

//code ASM.js
/**
Asm.js 

* Still experimental
* Supported Mozilla (FireFox, Spider Monkey engine)

What do I do with it?

* Compiled C/C++ applications into ASM.js JavaScript. 
* Principal target: Games written in C++, that can be run in a Browser
* **Emscripten** is an LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler
