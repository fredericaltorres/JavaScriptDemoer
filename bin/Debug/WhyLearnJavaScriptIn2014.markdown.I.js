//code Very short history - The bad part
/**
* ***JavaScript*** created in 1995 (almost 20 years ago)

    * Bredan Eich as part of the Netscape Web Browser (*Legend says in 2 weeks*)

<center>![](../BredanEich.jpg)</center>

* It was adopted by million of Web users ***very quickly*** and **because**:<br/>

    * It was created for beginner
    * Compatibilty reason
    * Browser wars between Sun, Netscape and Microsoft

    * Designed by Committee (TC39, ECMAScript)
**/
//code Very short history - The bad part
/**
* The language contains some ***dangerous*** and ***stupid*** features

* That are not fixed and will not be fixed

**/

//code  Very short history - The good part
/**

* It is not as bad as it looks

* JavaScript is really ***misundertsood***

    * It looks like Java or C#, but is closer to LISP
    
    <pre>
        (defun factorial (N)
            (if (= N 1)
                1
            (* N (factorial (- N 1)))))
</pre>            

    * Developers say they hate JavaScript, *but what they really hate is the DOM*

    * Developers think they know JavaScript without ever having read a book about it
        * That was my case until 2010 <BR/><BR/>
        
* Some of most brillant features like ***First class function*** and ***Closure***
     
    * Features which have been more or less added to C# 3.5 and above

* Beyond

    * C, Pascal, C++, Java, C#, VB<br/><br/>

* The world of Dynamic Languages:

    * Python (Guido van Rossum, Netherlands)

/**
* What happened in 2008 ?


**/

//code In 2008 - V8
/**
* In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser

* The Chrome browser use the JavaScript engine called ***V8***
    * The first JavaScript engine use **Just In Time Compilation**<br/><br/>


* By 2014 all major browsers (FireFox (Ion Monkey), IE9 (Chakra), Safari) have some form of very fast JavaScript engine using JIT and other specific technologies.

**/
//code Since 2008
/**

* 2010 - CoffeeScript and Transcompiler

    * CoffeeScript is a programming language that **transcompiles** to JavaScript <BR/><BR/>

* 2011 - Node.js is a software platform to execute scalable server-side and networking applications
    * Web service and Web site
    * Use JavaScript Engine V8 (Very fast)
    * Non blocking IO architecture
    * Windows, MacOS, Linux
    * Extremely successfull
    * Microsoft has invested on NodeJS for Windows, Azur and Visual Studio<BR/><BR/>
    
* 2012, Microsoft released TypeScript which add Types to JavaScript.
 
**/
//code Since 2010
/**
* NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, RavenDB, Azure Mobile Service

* PhoneGap: Build HTML5 App for Mobile OS iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Black berry
    * Adobe/PhoneGap or Telerik AppBuilder provide compiler in the cloud.<BR/><BR/>

* 2012 ASM.JS - Experimental
    * Asm.js transforms a JavaScript runtime into a Fast Virtual Machine like JVM or .NET Runtime
        * C++ source --> Compile to LLVM --> Translate to ASM.js --> Fast execution in FireFox
        * But why? To execute game written in C++ in the browser with minimal rewriting.
