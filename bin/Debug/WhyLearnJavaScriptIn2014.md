## Why learning JavaScript in 2014?
 
Before we ***start***: 

* `Who never wrote a line of javaScript?
* `Who hate JavaScript?
* `Who do not understand javaScript?
* `Who ever read a book about JavaScript the language?

## Very short history - The bad part

* v1 was created in 1995 by Bredan Eich as part of the Netscape Web Browser (*Legend says in 2 weeks*)
<br />
* It was adopted by million of Web users very quickly and because:
    * It was created for beginner
    * Compatibilty reason
    * Browser wars between Sun, Netscape, Microsoft
    * Designed by Committee (TC39)

* `<h2>The language contains a lot dangerous and stupid features</h2>

## Very short history - The good part

* JavaScript is misundertsood
* It looks like Java (C, C#), it is closer to LISP.
<br />
JavaScript is a Dynamic, Object-Oriented, ***Functional*** Programming Language.

* If you want to know more about the history of JavaScript
<br />
* JavaScript the world's most misundertsood programming language by ***Douglas Crockford*** (JSON Discoverer).

* Is not just for the Web
* Can be extremely fast
* Since 2008 a lot of new tool and technologies have been created that use JavaScript
    * Server side applications
    * Mobile development
    * Database
    * New programming languages
    * Assembly language of the web - Portable virtual machine


## Reason to learn JavaScript 2014?

* Known and accepted by Developers and Companies from different technological background
* Interesting simple and powerfull language with only 26 reserved keywords

Let's review what happens since 2008

## 2008 - V8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser.
* The Chrome browser use the JavaScript engine called ***V8***, which was the first one released to use **Just In Time Compilation**
* By 2014 all major browsers (FireFox, IE9, Safari) have some form of very fast JavaScript engine using JIT and other specific technologies.
* V8 seems to be the fastest (specially on Windows)

## 2010 - CoffeeScript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In December 2010, Jeremy Ashkenas, released CoffeeScript 1.0 compiler
* CoffeeScript is a programming language that **transcompiles** to JavaScript
* The language is inspired by Ruby and Python to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability and adding additional features
* We have more and more language that transcompiles to javaScript:

    * Dart
    * Google Web Toolkit (Java -> JavaScript)
    * ClojureScript (Clojure language)
    
## 2011 - NodeJS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ryan Dahl, release NodeJs

* Node.js is a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications.
* Node.js use Google JavaScript engine V8

    * Maximize throughput and efficiency
    * Non-blocking I/O
    * Single-threaded

* Extremely Successfull
* Microsoft has invested on NodeJS for Windows and Azur

    * Optional
    * Ligth


## NoSQL Database
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MongoDB (use the Firefox JavaScript Engine)
* RavenDB (use the Jint JavaScript engine v 0.9, I am a contributor to Jint v 2)
* Windows Azur Mobile Service: Allow to customize the data getting in and out using JavaScript (I think they use NodeJS)


## HTML5 + Mobile + PhoneGap

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PhoneGap is a mobile development framework that enables software programmers to build applications for ***mobile devices*** using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

* PhoneGap Build http://phonegap.com/
* Telerik AppBuilder http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder

* iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Black berry and others

* Combined with library like jQuery Mobile or Sencha


## ASM.js
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asm.js comes from a new category of JavaScript application: 

* C/C++ applications that’ve been compiled into JavaScript. 

It’s a whole new genre of JavaScript application that’s been spawned by Mozilla’s Emscripten project.
